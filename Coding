  ". But their is so much more you could have done. Would you like to restartand try again: y/n.")
  
  final_question = input("y/n:").lower()

  if final_question == "y":
    main_story()
  elif final_question == "n":
    print("Bye")
  else:
    print("Couldnt understand that. Bye!")
main_story()
