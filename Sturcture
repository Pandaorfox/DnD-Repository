THE END. 

(Bartender):
(a)
[Good evening to you weary adventurer, here’s to a quiet night after a long day, eh? What’ll it be?:]
Honey Mead - 1gp
[The bartender sinks beneath the Oak plank bar table. While he’s doing this, you notice how weathered and worn the table is after years of abuse from unruly patrons. Before you can stare for too long, the barman catches your eyes again, only this time holding a plain but a delicious-looking glass of mead in his hands.]
Stiffler Amber Ale - 2gp
[The bartender calls over to a passing barmaid with rows of heavy pint glasses full of radiant golden Ale. It's such an entrancing sight to behold you almost don't notice the barman zipping up his pants.]
Bubbling Cider - 4gp
[You rack your brain thinking about what devilish incantations were involved in concocting this bubbling beverage. Nevertheless, down the hatch.]
Wine - 8gp
[Here’s your wine, you snob.]
Additional Actions:
Attack(May Incite Hostile Response)
Flee Engagement
Talk

(Regardless of Choice):
[It looks like you couldn’t handle your liquor. Before you can move a muscle, you begin to feel your consciousness slipping away and the musty Tavern floor beckoning you into it’s comforting arms as you fall off the barstool.]


The Next Morning:
[You open your eyes to a familiar sight, the Creaky Tankard Tavern. From where you awoke you are staring directly upwards at the lanterns hung on the ceiling and the underbelly of the ba table, oh, you’re on the floor. Fortunately for you, the bar keepers must have been too exhausted to drag you out onto the streets.]
Actions:
[Leave the tavern]
[Look Around]

(Look Around):
[You struggle to regain your mental faculties in order to look around but strangely enough you don’t have to look too hard. Right beside you is a broken bottle of rum.]
Actions:
[Take Bottle]
[Hair of the Dog that bit You]
[Leave] 

(Take Bottle):
[It’s not much, however, perhaps it could prove useful as a makeshift shank in the event of a fight.]

(Hair of the Dog that bit you):
[There’s more than one reason you don’t want to be seen sipping the leftover grog from this bottle. As soon as you’re finished you make haste out the door.]


(Leave):
[In hopes of avoiding any fees incurred from your extended stay, you quickly will yourself through the excruciating pain of getting to your feet and haphazardly throw yourself out onto the streets.]

The Town of Willsdrey:
[The town you find now envelopes you is bustling with life in every corner from the throngs of rushing townsfolk to the grotto rats scouring the gutters for their next meal; this town is brimming with life and culture out of every pore. The roads precipitate endlessly beyond the periphery of your vision, however, in your drunken stupor you would rather only familiarize yourself with your immediate surroundings. Betwixt the deluge of horse-pulled carts clogging the dirt path, you spot a few notable storefronts.]

[Additional Action: Investigate Further]


(Investigate(DC 13):
Success:
[Though it’s difficult to make anything out through the commotion, in the stillness of the vacant sky you catch a glimpse of a towering forest peeking out above the skyline. Even at this distance, you can feel the sinister gaze cast by the Arboreal Monoliths. Though somehow, at the same time, something about them you can’t quite describe invites you into their depths. Before you can gawk any longer your trance is interrupted by the guttural screams of two men brawling on the ground just beside you. You notice that they appear to be vying over a medium sized sack wrapped in twine.] 
Failure:
[Unfortunately, you are still far too discombobulated to focus your attention on anything for long enough to discern anything new.]

(The Creaky Tankard Tavern):
[Unfortunately, upon attempting to open the front doors, you find they are now locked]

(Godot’s Weapon and Armor Forge):
[“Those blades in there… they weren’t just your typical ornate and fragile toothpicks crafted for nobles. They could bring down Giants!” You hear a passerby exclaim as he exited the immense Cobblestone fortress where, presumably, Gotod conducted his blacksmith duties. It had no doubt stood on this land far longer than any other building in the area, feudal in contrast to the buildings surrounding it and clearly embattled by time and weather yet no less the impregnable castle it had always been; the cracks in its walls displayed flagrantly like the scars of a proud veteran warrior.]

Actions:
[Proceed]
[Leave]

(Leave):
[Redo Willsdrey Village Scene]

(Proceed):
[Opening the doors to the building sends a gust of wind into the building, rustling the leaves at your feet and sending horripilations repelling down your spine. After closing the door behind you you are presented with a spiral staircase with no railing that winds down into the bowels of the fortress. As you descend deeper you soon begin to hear a sharp clanking sound echoing through the chamber, almost mistakable for your footsteps at first but soon becoming the deafening and distinct sound of a hammer striking an anvil. Soon enough, your intuition is realized, upon reaching the bottommost step you are greeted to the source of the sound.]

[“Well, a newcomer I see. I am Gotod, I serve this town as the humble smith forging new weapons. What is it are you searching for traveler?”]

Dialogue Actions:

(if Spectacles)
[A red path of light shines into the forest]

[The shore extends until it reaches its end at the base of a large cliff. Leaning onto the large upward extending wall is a shovel, and drawn next to it is an arrow pointing down into the sand]

[You pick up the shovel and start to dig. You keep digging, and digging, until you hit a sharp THUD. You have found a chest full of treasure!!! +100 gp, + Sacred dagger + Healing potion]  
*After treasure has been found*
[The shore extends until it reaches its end at the base of a large cliff. Leaning onto the large upward extending wall is a shovel, and below it is a hole dug with an empty Treasure chest. On the shore is a magic boat.]
(if Spectacles)
[There is a trail of red light leading into the town]
(in boat)
[The boat floats quietly across the grey lake, with water trickling behind it. Through the fog, You see the warm light of a lantern hanging by the door to a little wooden shack. The boat lands, and you hear a cackling laugh from the inside.]
(in Hut)  
[ Inside the hut there is an abominable Witch! She is about to turn your sorry arse into a toad when she eyes your backpack’s money inventory]
[“I will not turn you into a toad dear passenger, ONLY IF you purchase some of these goods from me!]

[The “old man” looks at you with fury in his eyes. He lifts his frail hands and points his boney fingers at you. ALAKAZAM!!!! You explode into a pile of blood and guts.
[you died]
How did you know I would be coming? 
[OoooH I know very much about this land here. I have been here a long time you know. For example, there is a fight going on inside the secret alleyway RIGHT NOW! But don’t tell anyone else I told you… Wouldn't want to accept that sort of responsibility. But this old wizar- I - I - I - mean, MAN, must be getting back to fishing… If only I have a hook…”]

[“It is YOU who chose to help ME, and have shown that you are worthy of my help!”]

How do I get to the underworld?
[“If you travel east into the woods, you will find a well that leads you there. However, I have heard from other non magic users that they cannot see the well all without using some sort of mystical equipment. Good luck, and may we not meet in the next world…”]

(If spectacles)  [There is a red light shining to the east]



(west)
(trees)
[As you walk along the leaf-strewn path, you notice that the woods become more dense. The light of day is less visible as the trees grow larger and crowd together, their wide branches intertwining. Birds also seem to be less common here, except for the occasional caw of a crow or raven.]

(east)
[The path ends at a large, grassy field. There’s something off about this clearing, but you can’t quite place it]

(If spectacles) 
[In the middle of the field is a large demonic well extending down into the earth. It radiates with a dark energy, and glows with a brilliant red light. The sound of chains emerges from the well as a human-sized cage is lifted to the top, almost beckoning you to go in.]
(goto well)
[At the mouth of the well is the hellish engravings that say “TO UNDERWORLD” 
(to underworld) 


Underworld:
(If you have the Gem of the dead in the Underworld, all undead attacks are put off, but it also has a 1/20 chance of breaking every movement. If it breaks, all is normal. )

[Everything here at the bottom of the well is dark. A single, sputtering torch stands beside a large stone door with various horrifying scenes engraved onto it.]
(open door)
[As you push against the door the wave of heat nearly knocks you back as the sound of screaming rings in your ears. The Underworld is dimly lit by pools of lava and spouts of flame that lick the ancient stalactites looming above you. A figure in a birdlike mask stands on the left side of the narrow pathway, slowly turning their head to face you as if they had not moved in years. A sickening cracking sound comes from their neck as their head’s rotation completes.]
(image reference: Ingward (DS1))
(Interact)
[“And what might your business here be? It seems you’re a newcomer here, surprisingly enough, considering that the well isn’t visible to the average mortal. Oh, but what are those spectacles? Curious, very curious indeed. Hmm, I am getting off-track. It’s been a long time since someone’s come down the well. What exactly are you doing here, young mortal?”]
I am looking for a lost magic box.
[“Hmmmmmm. Ah YES! That is right, I did see a spirit come down here with a funny looking box… Where did he go… I cannot remember. But if you look around long enough, it should turn up!]
[The bird masked man turns back to his normal position]
Just minding my own business. 
[“Well… Carry on.”]

You stumble into a dark room, and hear wheezing breathing… A pair of glowing red eyes appear across from you. A DEMON LEAPS OUT. “Prepare to DIE!”]

(get key)  
[As you grab the key and pocket it, the ground shakes with a terrible rumble. Behind you is a giant floating eyeball monster! You cannot reach it with your sword, only reachable by arrows. It’s eye begins to glow as a beam of light shoots out at you!}
(Floating eye can only be defeated by a bow and arrow) 
 

(south)
[You are back at the cage extending up to the surface]
(in)
[You are back at the well to the Underworld]

(look) 
[You have found the Bow of Hell, equipped with an infinite arrow set]  

(west)
[To the west is a long hall extending down beyond sight, endlessly]
(you can continue down this hall forever, with each block further amassing another goblin to attack you. To get to the box, you must say the magic word, KAZZOO, and then the floor will open up and you will see the box on an alter}  
-(west)
[Further down the hall, you see in the distance a throng of grueling gobins]
--(west)
[Three goblins approach you, and begin to attack!]
---(west)
[Four goblins approach you, and begin to attack!]

(KAZZOO)
The floor opens up and you fall down into the depths! A small path with lava on either side leads to an altar with a small golden box atop it. 
(get Box)
[The ground starts to shake. The Underworld is not pleased with you taking their prized possession. RUN!]
(RUN)
(must type “run” 20 times in under 15 second to escape, or else you die. If you misspell “run”, Then you trip and have to fight a skeleton. Once you are finished fighting the skeleton, the process restarts)

After RUN:
[You JUMP into the cage to the surface, and ZOOOOM back up to safety! The box in your hands is shining with a radiant light. You think to yourself, What could possibly be inside? Should I open it? The surface approaches and you are back in the field once again”       

IF (open box) 
[As you peep open the lid, the box FLIES OPEN, releasing a GIANT DRAGON OF DOOM! IT BREATHS ANGLY WITH FIRE AND CHAOS!]

Combat Mechanics:

Chance To Hit Mechanics:
Chance to hit affected by the following factors:
Starting Chance to Hit = 0%:Abilities(+70-110%):Enemy Location(-5-30%):CR Rating(-0-20%)
Location Debuff:
TBD based on the relative distance away from the PC.
Challenge Rating Archive:
D = 0% Hit Debuff
C = 5% Hit Debuff
B = 10% Hit Debuff
A = 15% Hit Debuff
S = 20% Hit Debuff
Attack Of Opportunity Granted if PC or Enemy flees Encounter. Essentially, if either party flees, the opposite side will be given the chance to land their attack based on the above-stated factors. If the attacking party lands the attack of opportunity, the opposing party’s flee attempt is failed. Vice Versa, if the attacking party fails the Attack of Opportunity then the opposing party’s flee attempt is successful.  
Weapon Mechanics:
Swords:
Durability = Maximum Damage Output Capacity that is detracted from by an amount equal to the damage dished out during a given attack action.
DPR(Damage Per Round) For swords, DPR is a single value yielded from a random roll between a given sword's minimum DPR and whatever its maximum DPR value is. To illustrate, A sword may have a maximum DPR value of 10(meaning 10 damage subtracted from enemy health), and yet, its minimum DPR value is 4 meaning that the actual damage output could be anywhere between 4-10 determined by a random roll. Furthermore, after the weapon damage is generated, the attack still needs to land which is determined by the buffs and debuffs listed above.
Daggers:
Daggers function identical to swords in how they output with one exception. The damage of a dagger is split up into two uniform random rolls whereas swords only require one roll. This means that generally speaking, a dagger will dish out significantly less damage than its sword counterpart, however, it has to chance to deal more damage in the end as its damage is rolled twice
