print("""You are in the midst of a uniquely unremarkable city afront rows of monotonously lifeless and dilapidated wood buildings mirrored across 
the opposite side of an appropriately dull beaten dirt path.
It seems the term lifeless not only fits the description of the tired architecture as you have yet to see even a rat scurry along the road. 
The only thing that stands out amongst the infinite span of the somber town is the dense and towering wall of forestry up ahead. 
I suppose something is better than nothing you tell yourself. 
However, even at a distance, you can pick up the palpable feeling of a most vile evil befalling the forest.""")
